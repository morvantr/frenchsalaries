    <p id='description1'>For the location, this is explained by the attractiveness of the cities, departments and regions in terms of their infrastructure (universities, airports, cultural sites, etc.) and their geographical location (proximity to the sea, for example). And the number of companies that are located in these different cities is directly related to this.</p>
    <p id='description2'>Secondly, age is directly related to experience and therefore to the functions we can access, which explains why there are large wage gaps between the 18-25 and over-50 age groups.</p>
    <p id='description3'>Finally, there is a significant gender gap. Wage inequalities between men and women are still a major problem in the world, and France is no exception, since unfortunately, in full-time equivalents, women still earn 18% less than men.</p>
    <p id='description4'>But there are still a lot of other factors that play into these wage disparities and it's hard to find datasets that allow me to show them all in this map.</p>
